Summary:<br>
This is a Campus Network Project implemented on Cisco Packet Tracer. Each device from a different campus can communicate with each other and with external e-mail server. All the devices are connected in end-to-end topology can acquire IP addresses dynamically through DHCP server.  <br> <br>
Key Points of the Network Topology:<br>
•	1 Main campus and 1 Small campus<br>
•	Main campus includes:<br>
	Building A (consists of 4 Departments, namely, Admin, HR, Finance, Business)<br>
	Building B (consists of 2 departments namely, Engineering and Arts faculty)<br>
	Building C (consists of 2 departments namely, Students lab and IT department)<br>
	Each department has a PC and a Printer except for the IT department, which has 1 PC, 1 FTP Server and 1 Web Server.<br> <br>
•	Small Campus includes:<br>
	2 departments of the Health & Safety Faculty on different floors. On Floor 1 there are Student Labs and on Floor 2 there are Staff Labs.<br>
	Each department has a PC and a Printer.<br> <br>
Requirements:<br>
•	Configure devices and provide end-to-end connectivity and access to the internal servers and the external server.<br>
•	Each department is expected to be on its own separate IP network.<br>
•	The switches should be configured with VLANs.<br>
•	RIPv2 should be used to provide routing for the routers in the internal network and static routing for the external server.<br>
•	The devices are expected to acquire dynamic IP address from the router-based DHCP server.<br>
